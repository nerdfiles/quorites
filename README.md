# Quorites

Quorites are question sets which are perishable in that answering them gives 
them a maturity quotient increase. Students answer questions like, "How often 
do you make flash cards?", "How many days a week do you have homework?" Then 
questions from topics of a domain are organized and offered for the learning 
session. The question sets fall under each topic after a difficulty is 
assigned in terms of term complexity, term count, etc.; as students answer 
question sets for the topic, they "perish" such that the topic is rejuvenated 
given a certain number of rounds. Depending on the month, students can drag 
more difficult questions between time-frames to more organically plan their
learning rounds.
